What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	When you initialize a repository, the folder which will later hold
	the repository's metadata is created. If you do not initialize the 
	repository it isn't a repository, just a directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area gives you the opportunity to group files together that you
	want to commit to the repository together.
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to determine how to use a text editor to record commit comments. After
	I do that I will likely use Git to keep track of my personal coding along with
	files like resumes.
