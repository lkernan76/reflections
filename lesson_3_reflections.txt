When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If you are collaborating with others, using a remote repository makes sense so that 
  all will have access to the repository. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Especially when dealing with a public repository, but even with a private one, it
	makes sense to only send to GitHub what you are ok with others seeing rather than
	having GitHub automatically syncing your local and remote repositories.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Forks are only possible on GitHub. Forking a repository is making a copy to your
	GitHub account of someone else's repository on GitHub. To clone a repository is
	to make a copy of either a local or remote repository. Branching is what you do
	when you want to try an experimental change to what is in the master branch of 
	your repository.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?

	With the last known state stored locally you can review it offline.
